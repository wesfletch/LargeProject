Sorry for the delay!

To run the server, in terminal run the following commands in order:
    npm install
    npm start

While making the endpoints I started working on a basic fronted to get
an idea of how I should handle the data. I initally made the favorite data
it's own schema but then then just added as fields part in the user 
and friend schemas, but never updated the client to reflect that. 
So, if you try to run the client it won;t work well.

To run the client, in terminal run the following commands in order:
    cd client
    npm install
    npm start
